## Sample Detection

The following images show the detection system in action, identifying **person, bottle, and remote** in the same frame:

This project implements a **real-time object detection system** using Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv4.  
It is designed to detect and classify multiple objects in images or video streams simultaneously. The system is capable of recognizing common objects such as **person, bottle, remote**, and more, providing bounding boxes and labels for each detected object.  

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of YOLOv4 for real-time detection while keeping the system lightweight enough to run on a standard local computer. This makes it ideal for educational purposes, experimentation, and prototype development in computer vision applications.

Key aspects of this project include:  
- **Multi-object detection:** Detect multiple objects in a single frame accurately.  
- **Real-time performance:** Processes video streams in real time with YOLOv4.  
- **Lightweight and portable:** Can run locally without complex dependencies.  
- **Customizable:** You can easily add new classes or adjust detection thresholds.  
- **Demonstration-ready:** Includes sample images showing detection of objects like person, bottle, and remote simultaneously.

This project is ideal for anyone learning about **computer vision**, **deep learning**, or **object detection**, providing a hands-on example of YOLOv4 integration with Python and OpenCV.
